## Resources

- SaveMyExams Notes:
    - The following PDFs have been converted from screenshots and combined to form an amalgamated version of the standard revision notes from SaveMyExams's publicly available Revision Notes. The elements that were deemed extraneous have been deliberately removed to enhance the focus of the student.

- The most recent previous examination papers have been acquired through the utilization of a Google Dorking technique, which exploits a minor vulnerability of a server. I had duly reported this matter, providing clear instructions on how to reproduce the issue and outlining a viable solution to remedy it. However, it appears that no remedial action has been taken.

- Other Past Papers are taken from the SaveMyExams site
